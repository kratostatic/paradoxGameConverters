# Overall structure :
#
# default = { 
#	map = { 
#		... 
#	} 
#	division_templates = {
#		...
#	}		
# }
#
# Vic2 Mod-specific mappings can be defined by copying the "default = { map = { ... } division_templates = { ... } }"  section
# and pasting it by replacing "default" with the appropriate mod name
#
# For example : 
# PDM = { 
#	map = { 
#		... 
#	} 
#	division_templates = { 
#		... 
#	} 
# }
# 
# The "map" section format is used to establish which HoI4 units the Vic2 units are transformed into. It has the following structure :
# 
# map = {
# 	link = { 
#		vic = <Vic2 unit type>
Â£
#		hoi = {
#			type = <land/air/naval/convoy>
#			unit = <HoI4 unit type> (Valid Battalion/Support Company, Aircraft type or Naval Vessel type)
#			equipment = <equipment_type>
#			size = <integer number>	
#		}		
# 	}
#	...
#	link = {
#		...
#	}
# }
# 
#  
# EXAMPLE :
#
# map = {
# 	# Map every Vic2 Infantry Brigade to 3 x HoI4 Infantry Battalion with the most basic equipment
# 	link = {
# 		vic = infantry 
# 		
# 		hoi = {
# 			type = land
# 			unit = infantry
# 			equipment = infantry_equipment_0
# 			size = 3
# 		}
# 	}
# 	# Map every Vic2 Plane units to 10 x Interwar Fighter
# 	link = {
# 		vic = plane
# 		
# 		hoi = {
# 			type = air
# 			unit = fighter
# 			equipment = fighter_equipment_0
# 			size = 10
# 		}
# 		
#
# 	}
# 	# Map every Vic2 Commerce Raider to a HoI4 Destroyer of the most basic model
# 	link = {
# 		vic = commerce_raider
# 		
# 		hoi = {
# 			type = naval
# 			unit = destroyer
# 			equipment = destroyer_1
# 			size = 1
# 		}		
# 	}	
# }
# 
# Specifying no "hoi" section means that those Vic2 units will not be mapped.
#
# In addition to the above, Division Templates must be defined so that mapped Vic2 ground units are grouped in viable formations.
# The Division Templates have the same structure as found in HoI4.
# The order in which the templates are defined matters. The converter will first try to convert as many divisions of the current type
# and when there are no longer sufficient mapped units available it moves to the next template.
#
# 
# EXAMPLE :
#
# division_templates = {
#
# 	# This is a Regular-Priority Infantry Division with 2 x Infantry Regiments, 3 x Battalions Each + 1 x Artillery Regiment with 3 x Battalions and an Engineer Company
#	division_template = {
#		name = "Infantry Division"
#	
#		regiments = {
#			infantry = { x = 0 y = 0 }
#			infantry = { x = 0 y = 1 }
#			infantry = { x = 0 y = 2 }			
#						
#			infantry = { x = 1 y = 0 }
#			infantry = { x = 1 y = 1 }
#			infantry = { x = 1 y = 2 }
#			
#			artillery_brigade = { x = 2 y = 0 }
#			artillery_brigade = { x = 2 y = 1 }
#			artillery_brigade = { x = 2 y = 2 }
#		}
#		
#		support = {
#			engineer = { x = 0 y = 0 }
#		}
#		
#		priority = 1
#	}
#	
# 	# This is an Elite-Priority Cavalry Division with 3 x Cavalry Regiments, 3 x Battalions Each and a Recon Company
