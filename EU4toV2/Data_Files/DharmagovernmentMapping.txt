#After Dharma (since 1.26) EU4 government conversion mechanics
#Until integrated, I owe you syntax explanation:
#Each reform gives a +1 probability of a certain government being chosen
#e.g.: feudalism_reform=absolute_monarchy means that countries with feudalism_reform
#will have a +1 chance of getting absolute_monarchy in Vic2
#They are all grouped here by the government groups given by EU4
#Upon counting how many points a country's government has, the one with most points
#will become the government.
